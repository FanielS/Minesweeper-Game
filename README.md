# Minesweeper-Game
Minesweeper is a game of logic where the player is presented with a field full of hidden mines. The goal is to mark the positions of all mines without setting
any of them off. It's not a game of wild guessing: it offers hints showing the number of mines around each cell. One wrong move, and game over!
